    "## Background\n",
    "We are working on comparing different algorithms that extract the depth of melt ponds on Amery ice shelf from ATL03 photon data (see images below). Because *humans tend to be pretty talented at recognizing patterns in such unstructured data*, we want to investigate how the algorithm estimates compare to where humans would draw the melt pond surface and bed in these data. \n",
